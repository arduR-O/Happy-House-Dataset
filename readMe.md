# Dataset
Dataset has been taken from Deep Learning Specialization - Course 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks. It can be used to detect whether the person in image is similing or not 

# My Implementation
* Dataset can be accessed from nested folder in content folder, it has been saved that way to correspond with colab file structure
* happy_model.keras contains parameters I trained on google colab and can be used straightaway
* The notebook is reasonably well commented  

# Result
Accuracy: 98.6%
